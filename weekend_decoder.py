### WEEKEND DECODER

# Load file1.csv and channel.csv as vectors

# Split into 1056 bit length OFDM 'symbols'

# Remove first 32 elements of each 'symbol'

# DFT of each 'symbol' (...should be complex)

# Divide by DFT of Channel Impulse Response (??)

# For each element, find closest conselation symbol (√2 + √2 j, √2 - √2 j, -√2 - √2 j, - √2 + √2j)

# Match each conselation symbol to the bits (Gray code)

# Convert to .txt (how, not sure!)
